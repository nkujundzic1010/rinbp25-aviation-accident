# Functional and Technical Specification
## Aviation Accident Network Analysis Project

### 1. Project Overview
This project aims to analyze aviation accidents as a network, comparing SQL and NoSQL database approaches. The project will begin with data collection and proceed through analysis implementation.

### 2. Data Collection Requirements

#### 2.1 Data Sources
Primary source: Wikipedia aviation accidents and incidents
Required data fields to scrape:
- Temporal data:
    - Year
    - Date
- Location data:
    - Location of accident
    - Flight origin
    - Destination
- Aircraft information:
    - Aircraft type
    - Registration
    - Operator
- Casualty information:
    - Number of passengers
    - Crew count
    - Total occupants
    - Number of injuries
    - Fatalities
    - Survivors
    - Missing persons
- Additional information:
    - Accident cause/summary

#### 2.2 Web Scraping Implementation
- Develop Python scraper using:
    - BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for HTML parsing
    - Pandas for data structuring
    - Regular expressions for text cleaning
- Store initial data in Excel/CSV format
- Implement data validation during scraping

### 3. Database Design

#### 3.1 PostgreSQL Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE locations (
    location_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    location_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    country TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE operators (
    operator_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    operator_name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE aircraft (
    aircraft_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    registration TEXT,
    operator_id INTEGER REFERENCES operators(operator_id)
);

CREATE TABLE accidents (
    accident_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE,
    year INTEGER,
    aircraft_id INTEGER REFERENCES aircraft(aircraft_id),
    origin_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(location_id),
    destination_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(location_id),
    location_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(location_id),
    passengers INTEGER,
    crew INTEGER,
    occupants INTEGER,
    injuries INTEGER,
    fatalities INTEGER,
    survivors INTEGER,
    missing INTEGER,
    cause TEXT
);
```

#### 3.2 Neo4j Graph Model
Nodes:
```
(:Location {
    name: string,
    country: string
})

(:Aircraft {
    type: string,
    registration: string
})

(:Operator {
    name: string
})

(:Accident {
    id: integer,
    date: date,
    year: integer,
    passengers: integer,
    crew: integer,
    fatalities: integer,
    survivors: integer,
    cause: string
})
```

Relationships:
```
(:Location)-[:DEPARTURE_OF]->(:Accident)
(:Location)-[:DESTINATION_OF]->(:Accident)
(:Location)-[:ACCIDENT_SITE_OF]->(:Accident)
(:Aircraft)-[:INVOLVED_IN]->(:Accident)
(:Operator)-[:OPERATES]->(:Aircraft)
```
